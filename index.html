		<h1>Happy fifth monthsary babii.</h1>
		<p>We&#39ve been through a lot together in these five months, and each day I feel more grateful to have you by my side. I feel incredibly lucky to have you in my life. </p>
		
	<p>	Since you came, you&#39ve made everything better, and I wouldn&#39t trade this for anything else because with you, I&#39m happy and content. I want you to know that I love you so much more than the bad days ahead of us. Bad days can come and go but my love for you will always be constant. And, even though I&#39m not perfect, I&#39m always striving to be better for you and to deserve you.</p>
	
	<p>Also, I&#39m really sorry we always haven&#39t celebrated our monthsary on the exact day : ( . I know I&#39ve said we&#39d celebrate it but I&#39m sorry it hasn&#39t always worked out that way. I&#39m really sorry :( </p>
	
	<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
		
		<p> --To many more months and years together. I love you so much, and I&#39m looking forward to all the memories we&#39ll make in the future.

		<p>	I love you so much, Lexiane Olila De Chavez. </p>
		
	<p>	Again, Happy 5th monthsary, babii! </p>
